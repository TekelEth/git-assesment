## Explain difference between Git Fetch and Got Pull
The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. 

> git fetch origin main
> git pull origin main

## Explain git rebase and the command used for it
The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository.

> git rebase --interactive HEAD~7


## Explain in simple terms git cheery pick and explain the command used for it.
git cherry-pick is a powerful command that enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD.
Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes.

> git cherry-pick
